* This is my notes and progress with course called **Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)**.
* Why I am taking this course ? I want to study in depth how a system and OS of a computer can be build from scratch and I found this course very helpful, it also talking a lot about basic stuff I took in collegue like in computation course.
* Course on coursera [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).
* [Web-based IDE](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/chip/).
* [Course official website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course)

* Note1 : [docs](./docs) folder have the github markdown version instead of obsidian one, so read it for notes about the topics and the projects.
* Note2 : Files names have specific structure:
    * projects notes --> project_{project_number}_note.md
    * Units notes --> Unit_{unit_number}_{unit_topic}.md

## Key concepts

- **Boolean Algebra = system/rules** (like mathematics itself).
- **Boolean Expression = formula** written using those rules.
